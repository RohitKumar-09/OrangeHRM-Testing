# OrangeHRM-Testing
This repository documents the manual testing of the OrangeHRM system, covering key modules such as Login, Employee Management, Leave Management, Time & Attendance, and Recruitment. Comprehensive test cases were designed and executed to verify core functionalities and ensure system stability. Several critical bugs were identified, including the login page accepting invalid credentials without proper error messages, employee records not updating correctly after modifications, leave requests being approved despite insufficient leave balance, and the recruitment module failing to update candidate status accurately. Defect clustering principles were applied to identify high-defect areas, improving testing efficiency. The testing process involved structured test planning, execution, and defect reporting to ensure quality assurance. Technology used includes Excel for test case documentation and bug tracking, MS Word for test planning, and the OrangeHRM demo environment for application validation.
